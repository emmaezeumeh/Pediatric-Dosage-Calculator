# Pediatric-Dosage-Calculator

## [Application of The Pediatric Dosage Calculator]


Children of the same age grow at different rates. For children in the same age group, there are wide variations in their weight . Consequently, dosages are usually calculated using their weight. It is important to ensure that every child is getting the optimum and safe dose required for them to receive quality healthcare.

## [Long Term Goal]


To expand the functions of the calculator to be able to calculate doses for other special populations. Thereafter, create an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be embedded into a Pharmacy Health Information Technology (HIT) solution which will help Pharmacists quickly  determine doses required for many special populations.

## [Project Description]


### Plan: 
To develop a Python program that will help calculate compounding doses for pediatric populations.

### Modules: 
Functions, Database & GUI.

### Dataflow/ major functionalities:
Users will use entry widget to input patient relevant information.
Formulas to be used to calculate the doses will be defined with functions and stored to a database.
The calculated doses will be outputted in an info dialog box.

### Input: 
Relevant patient information, and medication name

### Output: 
Calculated dose

## [How to run]
Run the Dosage Calculator.py and DosageCalculator database.pyfrom the terminal using python notebook.py
The program will accept data from the user and store patient information to the database.
It will generate graphs and store them in the graphs directory

## [Dependencies]
Tkinter 8.6
MySQL Workbench 8.0.31
